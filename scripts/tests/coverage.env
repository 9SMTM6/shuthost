# Environment variable for LLVM coverage profiling
# This sets the path where coverage profile files (.profraw) are written
# Adjusted for the container's mounted volume (/repo)
#
# Note: This variable only takes effect when the binary was compiled with
# coverage instrumentation (e.g., via RUSTFLAGS with --cfg=coverage).
# Without instrumentation, no .profraw files will be generated.
#
# Additionally, the binary must be properly terminated (e.g., via SIGTERM)
# for the coverage data to be flushed to disk. The controller listens for
# terminate signals to ensure clean shutdown and coverage data writing.
