The role of this document is to provide guidance for common mistakes and confusion points for agents in this project. If you encounter something in this project that you find confusing, please alert the developer and indicate a short fix in this document.

- **Playwright**: `just playwright --reporter=line` (line reporter avoids blocking output).
- **Rust tests**: `just cargo_tests <pattern>` to run tests matching a workspace package pattern.
- **DB migrations**: `just db_add_migration <name>` creates a new timestamped `.sql` file under `coordinator/migrations/`. Then fill in the SQL. sqlx applies migrations automatically. The migration filename (including the timestamp prefix generated by sqlx) must not be renamed after creation.
- **sqlx query cache**: After adding new `sqlx::query!` / `sqlx::query_as!` calls, run `just db_update_sqlx_cache` to regenerate the offline cache (`.sqlx/`). Requires the dev DB to have migrations applied (`just db_create` if starting fresh).
<!-- TODO: add just show_test_blocking_processes part, and/or fix that code. Note that I currently regularly need to clean up leftover processes, something doesnt seem to work correctly. -->
