## 🧭 ShutHost Design & Operation

ShutHost began from a simple observation: Wake-on-LAN (WOL) is reasonably standardized for starting machines on a LAN, but there is no well-established, safe equivalent for remotely shutting down running systems. Some projects try to solve this—for example, [sleep-on-lan](https://github.com/SR-G/sleep-on-lan) and snippets/guides that log in via SSH and shut down the computer that way—but those approaches commonly enlarge the attack surface, are difficult to deploy, and lack usability.

ShutHost addresses these challenges through three key design decisions:

- **Authorization & safety:** Remote shutdown commands pose risks of accidental or malicious denial-of-service. To mitigate this, ShutHost requires authenticated requests: shutdowns are authorized using HMAC-signed messages with timestamps to prevent replay attacks and avoid sending plaintext credentials over the network.
- **Privilege & init integration:** Performing a shutdown usually requires elevated privileges and must persist across reboots. ShutHost provides lightweight host agents that integrate with common service managers so the shutdown capability is available after restarts. Supported integrations include `systemd` (the dominant init on most mainstream Linux distributions), `openrc` (used by distributions like Alpine and Gentoo), and `launchd` (macOS). A "self-extracting" mode is also available for custom or manual setups where users handle init integration themselves (see [Deploying the Self-Extracting Agent on Unraid](docs/examples/unraid-self-extracting-agent-deployment.md) for an example).
- **Network reachability & central control:** Wake-on-LAN only operates on the local broadcast domain. To manage hosts from outside the LAN, ShutHost includes a coordinator component: a single LAN-hosted coordinator provides a web GUI (installable as a PWA) and an API. The coordinator sends WOL packets to start machines locally and forwards authenticated shutdown requests to host agents over IP.

Host agents are intentionally minimal and designed for security. They use IP-addressed, authenticated requests and avoid running full-featured HTTP servers. This reduces the attack surface for components that typically run with elevated privileges. The `host_agent` performs the actual shutdown and registers with the host's service manager so the capability survives reboots. The `host_agent` can also be used standalone; its API is documented in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md). The `host_agent` supports custom shutdown commands, allowing users to define how their systems should be powered down or put to sleep—this can also be seen in the [Unraid example](docs/examples/unraid-self-extracting-agent-deployment.md).

The coordinator glues the pieces together and provides usability features:

- A web UI and API make it easy to start/stop machines and integrate with other services.
- The coordinator doesn't require elevated privileges to run.
- The coordinator offers an installer and convenience scripts that simplify deploying `host_agent`s on the LAN and clients over the internet.
- A lease system prevents hosts from being shut down while a client holds an active lease (for instance, while a backup job is running).
  > This safety depends on all starts and stops going through the coordinator (either the UI or a client using the coordinator API); actions performed outside the coordinator are outside its control.

For a visual overview, see the architecture diagram: [Architecture](https://9smtm6.github.io/shuthost/#architecture)

## 💿 Installation

Choose either the binary (recommended for reliability and WOL support) or the container (Linux only) installation.

#### Binary (recommended)
- Use the [automated installation script](scripts/enduser_installers/coordinator.sh):
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/latest/download/shuthost_coordinator_installer.sh | sh
  ```
  This script will automatically detect your platform, download the appropriate binary, verify the checksum (with user confirmation), and install the coordinator as a system service.

- Or follow the manual steps:
  - Download the latest release from: https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/latest
      ```bash
      uname -m
      # Possible outputs: x86_64 => Intel/AMD, aarch64 => ARM/Apple Silicon
      ```
      ```bash
      # Linux on Intel/AMD
      curl -fL -o shuthost_coordinator.tar.gz "https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/latest/download/shuthost_coordinator-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz"
      # There are also gnu binaries available, but the musl variants have wider compatibility for users that dont know which version of libc they have.
      ```
      ```bash
      # Linux on ARM
      curl -fL -o shuthost_coordinator.tar.gz "https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/latest/download/shuthost_coordinator-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz"
      ```
      ```bash
      # macOS on Apple Silicon
      curl -fL -o shuthost_coordinator.tar.gz "https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/latest/download/shuthost_coordinator-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz"
      ```
      ```bash
      # macOS on Intel
      curl -fL -o shuthost_coordinator.tar.gz "https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/latest/download/shuthost_coordinator-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz"
      ```
      ```bash
      # Optionally verify the checksum against the one provided on the releases page
      shasum -a 256 shuthost_coordinator.tar.gz
      # Extract the downloaded archive
      tar -xzf shuthost_coordinator.tar.gz
      rm shuthost_coordinator.tar.gz
      ```
  - Install as a system service (binary supports systemd/openrc/launchd)
    ```bash
    # Run the installer (installs binary, creates a config with restrictive permissions and enables start-on-boot)
    # optionally specify the user as first argument (inferred from SUDO_USER if run under sudo, otherwise that argument is required)
    sudo ./shuthost_coordinator install
    # Remove the binary (it'll have been copied to the appropriate location by the installer)
    rm shuthost_coordinator
    # Access the WebUI at http://localhost:8080
    ```
- Notes:
  - The installer will create service units for systemd or openrc where appropriate and set config file ownership/permissions.

#### Docker (Linux only)
-  Download the [example_config.toml](docs/examples/example_config.toml) and [docker-compose.yml](docs/examples/docker-compose.yml) from Github and run the service:
    ```bash
    # Create config directory and download the example config from GitHub
    mkdir -p coordinator_config data
    curl -L -o coordinator_config/config.toml \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/main/docs/examples/example_config.toml
    
    # Set restrictive permissions (readable/writable by owner only)
    chmod 600 coordinator_config/config.toml
    # Download the docker-compose file
    curl -L -o docker-compose.yml \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/main/docs/examples/docker-compose.yml
    
    # Run the service in the background
    docker-compose up -d shuthost
    
    # Access the WebUI at http://localhost:8080
    ```
- Notes:
  - Uses `network_mode: host` to reach the hosts with the Wake-on-LAN packet. This setting is Linux-only and will not work properly on Docker Desktop for Mac/Windows. Use the binary on Mac or run on a Linux VM with bridged networking on Mac or Windows.

### Agent / Client installation
- To install a host-agent (controls the hosts): open the web UI, open "Install Host Agent" and follow the instructions shown.
- To install a client (M2M, e.g., backup scripts): switch to the Clients tab, open "Install Client" and follow the instructions shown.

## ⚡ Agent-only Install

[UNRELEASED]

Lightweight option: install the host agent only (no coordinator). This does not require an always-on coordinator or a domain; it is easy to deploy but has limitations — the control scripts work only on the same LAN. See the detailed example in [docs/examples/agent-installation.md](docs/examples/agent-installation.md).

Install the released agent installer and generate a direct-control script:

```bash
# Install the agent (released installer):
curl -fsSL https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/latest/download/shuthost_host_agent_installer.sh | sh

# Generate a direct-control script (run on the machine where the agent binary is installed):
# If the agent is in your PATH:
shuthost_host_agent generate-direct-control

# Make the script executable and move it to the device you want to use as the controller (same LAN):
chmod +x shuthost_direct_control_<hostname>
# copy via scp, USB, etc.
```

After moving the direct-control script to the controller device, you can run `./shuthost_direct_control_<hostname> wake`, `./shuthost_direct_control_<hostname> status` or `./shuthost_direct_control_<hostname> shutdown` while on the same LAN. See the example document for tradeoffs and security notes.
