A neat helper that manages the standby state of unix hosts with Wake-On-Lan (WOL) configured, with Web-GUI.

> Note: LARGE parts of this project were LLM generated. None were blindly committed, but it is what it is.

[![Live demo: PWA controlling NAS aka old PC (2x speed)](docs/shuthost_live_demo_2x.webp)](./docs/shuthost_live_demo_2x.webp)
> played at 2x speed, using the WebUI installed as PWA

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: the short demo clip shown above is slightly out of date with respect to theming and layout. Check the [live demo](https://9SMTM6.github.io/shuthost/) or [screenshots below](#-ui-screenshots) for the current UI.

## üåê Live Demo

You can try a demo of the ShutHost WebUI (no backend, simulated data) via GitHub Pages:

- [Live Demo](https://9SMTM6.github.io/shuthost/)

This demo runs entirely in your browser and does not control any real hosts. It is useful for previewing the UI and features without installing anything.
Note that the theme (light/dark) is selected based on your system preference.

## üíø Installation

Choose either the binary (recommended for reliability and WOL support) or the container (Linux only) installation.

Binary (recommended)
- Download the latest release from:
  - https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/latest
- Example (adjust filename for the asset you downloaded):
  ```bash
  curl -L -o shuthost_coordinator "https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/download/latest/shuthost_coordinator-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
  chmod +x shuthost_coordinator
  ```
- Install as a system service (binary supports systemd/openrc/launchd)
  - Install command (runs the chosen platform service installer, creates config with correct permissions and enables start-on-boot):
    ```bash
    # Linux (recommended run with sudo)
    sudo ./shuthost install <optional user>

    # macOS (user is required on macOS)
    sudo ./shuthost install your-username
    ```
  - Notes:
    - On Linux the installer infers the target user from SUDO_USER if you run under sudo.
    - The installer will create service units for systemd or openrc where appropriate and set config file ownership/permissions.

Docker (Linux only)
- Run with the host network so broadcasts and LAN reachability work:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm --network host \
    -v ./coordinator_config.toml:/config/coordinator_config.toml:ro \
    ghcr.io/9smtm6/shuthost/shuthost-coordinator:latest
  ```
- docker-compose example:
  ```yaml
  version: "3.8"
  services:
    shuthost:
      image: ghcr.io/9smtm6/shuthost/shuthost-coordinator:latest
      network_mode: "host"      # required for WOL
      restart: unless-stopped
      volumes:
        - ./coordinator_config/:/config/:ro
      # no ports, since network_mode: host
  ```
-  Both with config file
  ```toml
  # coordinator_config.toml
  # ensure only you can read this file with `chmod 600 $(whoami) ./coordinator_config/coordinator_config.toml`
  [server]
  port = 8080 # change accordingly
  bind = "127.0.0.1" # forward to this with your local reverse proxy with TLS.

  [server.auth.token]
  # token = "change-me" # uncomment and change to a secure token to avoid auto-generation on each start

  [hosts]

  [clients]
  ```
- Notes:
  - `--network host` is Linux-only and will not work properly on Docker Desktop for Mac/Windows. Use the binary there or run on a Linux VM with bridged networking.

Quick links & notes
- Release: https://github.com/9SMTM6/shuthost/releases/latest
- Homebrew / distro packages: Might be provided if there is community interest and/or support ‚Äî please file an issue or react to the appropriate.

Agent / Client installation
- To install a host-agent (controls the hosts): open the web UI, open "Install Host Agent" and follow the instructions shown.
- To install a client (M2M, e.g., backup scripts): switch to the Clients tab, open "Install Client" and follow the instructions shown.

## ÔøΩüìã Requirements

### ü§ñ Agent Requirements
For the requirements for the agent, see [Requirements to install the agent](frontend/assets/agent_install_requirements_gotchas.md).

### üñ•Ô∏è Coordinator Requirements

The coordinator must be run on a system that can reach the hosts you want to manage.

Assuming that the coordinator-host is on the same network as the hosts, with WOL broadcasts allowed, this requires additionally:
- üîß Running the coordinator as a **binary** on the coordinator-host, or
- üê≥ Running it in a **docker container** with the host network mode enabled

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This does not work with the default network mode that docker uses on Windows and MacOS. It will also not work on WSL. On these Hosts, you will have to run the coordinator as a binary, or install a Linux VM with bridged networking to run docker.

‚ùå **Windows is currently not supported**, even with the binary and/or WSL. You need a VM or a dedicated Linux machine.

### üåê WebUI Network Configuration

The coordinator binary exposes its server on `127.0.0.1` only by default - so on localhost, ipv4, without remote access. This is for security reasons.

#### üê≥ Docker Access
To access the WebUI served by the binary from Docker containers (e.g. NGINX), use the address:
```
http://host.containers.internal:<port>
```

Container solutions other than Docker (e.g. Podman) might require additional configuration.
On Podman, add the following to the container that wants to access the coordinator:
```yaml
extra_hosts:
  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

Alternatively, you can set the address the coordinator binds to in the configuration file.

## üîí Security

### üåê WebUI Security
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: The WebUI is **not secured by default**, you should enable the built-in authentication or use a reverse proxy that provides authentication, and do the same with TLS.

#### Built-in Authentication (optional)
ShutHost can also enforce simple auth on its own, either with a static token or with OIDC login. If you enable this, you don't need external auth.

In your `shuthost_coordinator.toml` add under `[server]`:

```toml
[server]
port = 8080
bind = "127.0.0.1"

# Choose one auth mode:

[server.auth.token]
# Token mode: provide a token or omit to auto-generate on startup (printed in logs, but that will be lost on restart)
# token = "your-secret-token"

# OIDC mode (authorization code flow with PKCE)
# [server.auth.oidc]
# issuer = "https://issuer.example.com/realms/foo"
# client_id = "shuthost"
# client_secret = "supersecret"
# # optional, defaults to ["openid","profile"]
# scopes = ["openid","profile"]

# External auth mode (reverse proxy or external authentication provider)
# [server.auth.external]
# exceptions_version = 1  # Version of exceptions acknowledged by operator

# Optional: base64-encoded cookie signing key (32 bytes). If omitted, a random key is generated
# cookie_secret = "base64-encoded-32-bytes=="
```

Note that auth modes are mutually exclusive, and both require TLS on the browser end, so need either configured TLS or a reverse proxy that provides TLS.

If proxy unencrypted traffic with an external proxy, this will not be detected, and poses a security risk, as well as a potential source for issues. Such a setup is neither recommended nor supported.

For external auth, you need to add the following exceptions. The WebUI will show you convenience configs for some auth providers if you set `exceptions_version=0`.

Public endpoints (bypass):
- `/download/*`, `/manifest.json`, `/favicon.svg`, `/architecture*.svg`
- `/api/m2m/*` (M2M API, e.g. for clients)

All other routes should be protected by your external auth.

#### TLS configuration
If you want the coordinator to serve HTTPS directly, add a `[server.tls]` table. Paths are interpreted relative to the config file when not absolute. Example:

```toml
[server.tls]
# cert_path = "./tls_cert.pem"    # path to certificate PEM (default: ./tls_cert.pem)
# key_path = "./tls_key.pem"     # path to private key PEM (default: ./tls_key.pem)
# persist_self_signed = true       # if true (default) generate and persist a self-signed cert when none provided
```

Behavior:
- If both `cert_path` and `key_path` point to existing files, the coordinator will use them for TLS.
- If the files they point to are absent and `persist_self_signed` is true (the default), the coordinator will generate a self-signed cert/key and write them to the provided locations for reuse across restarts.

### ü™™ Example: OIDC Authentication (tested with kanidm)

OIDC authentication in ShutHost has only been tested with kanidm. The following steps describe how to set up OIDC login using kanidm:

1. **Create the OAuth2 application in kanidm:**
   ```sh
   kanidm system oauth2 create shuthost "Shuthost" https://shuthost.example.com
   kanidm system oauth2 add-redirect-url shuthost https://shuthost.example.com/oidc/callback
   kanidm group create shuthost_users
   kanidm group add-members shuthost_users <groups or users allowed to see UI>
   kanidm system oauth2 update-scope-map shuthost shuthost_users profile openid
   kanidm system oauth2 show-basic-secret shuthost
   ```
   - Replace `https://shuthost.example.com` with your actual ShutHost URL.
   - Note the client secret output by the last command.

2. **Configure ShutHost to use OIDC:**
   In your `coordinator_config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [server.auth.oidc]
   issuer = "https://kanidm.example.com/oauth2/openid/shuthost"
   client_id = "shuthost"
   client_secret = "<the secret from above>"
   ```
   - Adjust the `issuer` URL to match your kanidm instance.
   - Use the client secret from the previous step.

3. **Restart ShutHost** to apply the changes.

> With this setup, users will be able to log in to the WebUI using their kanidm credentials. Only members of the `shuthost_users` group will have access.

### üõ°Ô∏è Agent Security
- ‚úÖ Host agents are secured with **HMAC signatures** and **timestamps** against replay attacks
- ‚úÖ Only the coordinator that knows these (shared) secrets can use them
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: All traffic between the coordinator and agents is **unencrypted** and only secured with HMAC signatures. This means that while status checks and commands are protected from tampering, anyone on the same LAN can observe the traffic and infer host statuses.

### üîê Client Security
- ‚úÖ The client is secured in the same way as agents are
- ‚úÖ The coordinator only accepts requests from **registered clients**

### üîß Reverse Proxy Configuration
To use the convenience scripts suggested by the WebUI, you will have to configure exceptions in the authorization of your reverse proxy, so that the requests from the host agents and clients are not blocked. These are detailed [above](#built-in-authentication-optional).

The WebUI will show you the required exceptions, alongside convenience configs for:
- üîë **Authelia**
- üåê **NGINX Proxy Manager** 
- üö¶ **Generic forward-auth in traefik**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

| Issue | Description | Impact | Solution |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| ÔøΩüîÑ **Missed Shutdown** | If the host misses the initial shutdown, a "full cycle" is required to send it again (release lease, take lease) | Medium | [APP-SIDE] Regularly "syncing" states, either with explicit config on the host or coordinator-wide |
| üíæ **State Loss** | The coordinator loses state on restart (including updates) | Low (currently only acts on state changes) | [APP-SIDE] Considering state persistence with e.g. sqlite or explicit syncing |
| ü™ü **Windows Support** | Windows agent support currently not planned, due to large differences in the way services are implemented | N/A | N/A |
| üåê **Docker Connectivity** | Accessing the coordinator from Docker requires proper configuration | Medium | Ensure proper Docker network configuration |
| üåê **Default Network Interface Selection** | The agent installation chooses the default network interface to determine the IP, MAC, etc. for the config, which may not always be correct | Low | Manually override the network interface in the configuration |
| üêß **glibc Version Errors** | On certain distributions (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04), the coordinator binary may fail due to incompatible glibc versions | Low | Use the **musl binary** or the **container** for the coordinator. For the agent the install script will recommend the correct override to get the musl binary if the original binary fails |
| üîè **Self-signed Certs & Install Scripts** | The client and agent install scripts may fail if you use self-signed certs without proxying these elsewhere | Medium | proxy self-signed certs through a trusted endpoint or provide accepted certs from letsencrypt |
| ü™™ **OIDC Session Revalidation** | OIDC login sometimes fails to revalidate the session and shows a generic OIDC error. Simply clicking "Login with SSO" again logs you in successfully. | Low | Currently undiagnosed due to lack of data. Workaround: click "Login with SSO" to log in. |
