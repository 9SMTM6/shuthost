/// Handles machine-to-machine lease actions (take/release) for a host.
///
/// This endpoint is intended for programmatic (m2m) clients and requires additional
/// authorization via HMAC-signed headers. The client must provide a valid `X-Client-ID`
/// and a signed `X-Request` header containing a timestamp, command, and signature.
///
/// The `action` path parameter must be either `take` or `release` and is mapped to the `LeaseAction` enum.
///
/// The `async` query parameter determines whether the host state change (wake/shutdown) is performed
/// synchronously (the request waits for the host to reach the desired state, up to a timeout) or asynchronously
/// (the request returns immediately after triggering the state change, and the host may still be transitioning).
///
/// - In synchronous mode (default), the request will block until the host is confirmed online (for take) or offline (for release),
///   or until a timeout is reached. This provides strong guarantees to the client about the host's state at the time of response.
/// - In asynchronous mode (`?async=true`), the request returns immediately after triggering the state change, and the host may still
///   be transitioning. This is useful for clients that want a fast response and can poll for state changes separately.
///
/// This is distinct from the web interface lease endpoints, which do not require authentication and are used for
/// user-initiated actions from the web UI. Use this endpoint for secure, automated lease management by trusted clients.
