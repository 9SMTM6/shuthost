                        With multiple clients potentially accessing hosts simultaneously, ShutHost introduces a 
                        <strong>lease system</strong> to coordinate access and prevent conflicts:

                        <li><strong>Lease Acquisition:</strong> Both WebUI and Clients must request leases before using hosts</li>
                        <li><strong>Automatic Startup:</strong> Hosts are automatically started when the first lease is acquired (â‰¥1 leases)</li>
                        <li><strong>Automatic Shutdown:</strong> Hosts are automatically shut down when all leases are released (=0 leases)</li>
                        <li><strong>Conflict Prevention:</strong> The lease system ensures hosts aren't shut down while still in use by other clients</li>

                    <li><strong>Both architectures use leases internally</strong> - the simplified view just hides this complexity</li>
                    <li><strong>Wake-on-LAN (WOL)</strong> is used for remote host startup in both cases</li>
                    <li><strong>Agents report status</strong> to keep the coordinator informed of host availability</li>
                    <li><strong>The coordinator serves the WebUI</strong> and provides the API for both human and programmatic access</li>
